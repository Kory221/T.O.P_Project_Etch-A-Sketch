# T.O.P_Project_Etch-A-Sketch
a "The Odin Project" cursus project.

In this project, you’ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex your DOM manipulation skills. You’re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.


1- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.

2- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

3- Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g., 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.

4- Extra credit - Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse by introducing a series of modifications.

Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse by introducing a series of modifications.

- Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squares’ RGB values with each interaction.
- Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black (or completely colored) square in only ten interactions.

You can choose to do either one or both of these challenges, it’s up to you.
